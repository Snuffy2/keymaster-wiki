# keymaster
Home Assistant keymaster integration for Z-Wave enabled locks. This integration allows you to control one (or more) Z-Wave enabled locks that have been added to your Z-Wave network. Besides being able to control your lock with lock/unlock commands, you can also control who may lock/unlock the device using the lock's front facing keypad. With the integration you may create multiple users or slots and each slot (the number depends upon the lock model) has its own PIN code.

Setting up a lock for the entire family can be accomplished in a matter of seconds. Did you just leave town and forgot to turn the stove off? through the Home Assistant interface you can create a new PIN instantly and give it to a neighbor and delete it later. Do you have house cleaners that come at specific times? With the advanced PIN settings you can create a slot that only unlocks on specific date and time ranges. You may also create slots that allow a number of entries, after which the lock won't respond to the PIN.

## Selecting a Z-Wave Network

Currently, there are three integrations that can be used to manage Z-Wave devices: [`zwave_js`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/), [`ozw`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ozw/), and [`zwave`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave/). The `zwave_js` integration is the newest integration and may currently have support for less devices than the other integrations, but it's being developed quickly and is currently slated to be the primary Z-Wave integration. The `ozw` integration is fairly stable but no more development is planned on it. The `zwave` integration is considered deprecated, but can still be used for now.

Before you install keymaster, you should consider which Zwave Network you want to use, `zwave_js`, `zwave`, or `ozw`.  We **strongly** suggest using `zwave_js` because it has more reliable communications with the locks we have tested, but `ozw` comes in at a close second.  While the `zwave` network works, we have had to add various hacks and workarounds for some of the locks, particularly some of the older ones.  We have had far fewer issues with the `zwave_js` and `ozw` network. The `zwave_js` network will soon be the default Z-Wave network for Home Assistant, so there is very little worry about switching now.

The only issue using `zwave_js` or `ozw` presents is you have to uninstall or disable your `zwave` network, and install zwave-js-server or ozwdaemon.  Depending on the type of your home assistant installation, this may be as easy as using the [add-on store](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/).  Or if you use docker, there is a [container for `zwave_js`](https://hub.docker.com/r/zwavejs/zwavejs2mqtt) and a [container for `ozw`](https://github.com/OpenZWave/qt-openzwave).
